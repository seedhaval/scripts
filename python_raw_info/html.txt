==============================
html.entities
HTML character entity references.

==============================
html.escape
(s, quote=True)
Replace special characters "&", "<" and ">" to HTML-safe sequences.
If the optional flag quote is true (the default), the quotation mark
characters, both double quote (") and single quote (') characters are also
translated.

==============================
html.unescape
(s)
Convert all named and numeric character references (e.g
&gt;, &#62;,
&x3e;) in the string s to the corresponding unicode characters.
This function uses the rules defined by the HTML 5 standard
for both valid and invalid character references, and the list of
HTML 5 named character references defined in html.entities.html5.
