==============================
glob.escape
(pathname)
Escape all special characters.
    

==============================
glob.fnmatch
Filename matching with shell patterns.

fnmatch(FILENAME, PATTERN) matches according to the local convention.
fnmatchcase(FILENAME, PATTERN) always takes case in account.

The functions operate by translating the pattern into a regular
expression
 They cache the compiled regular expressions for speed.

The function translate(PATTERN) returns a regular expression
corresponding to PATTERN
 (It does not compile it.)

==============================
glob.glob
(pathname, *, recursive=False)
Return a list of paths matching a pathname pattern.

The pattern may contain simple shell-style wildcards a la
fnmatch
However, unlike fnmatch, filenames starting with a
dot are special cases that are not matched by '*' and '?'
patterns.

If recursive is true, the pattern '**' will match any files and
zero or more directories and subdirectories.

==============================
glob.glob0
(dirname, pattern)
None

==============================
glob.glob1
(dirname, pattern)
None

==============================
glob.has_magic
(s)
None

==============================
glob.iglob
(pathname, *, recursive=False)
Return an iterator which yields the paths matching a pathname pattern.

The pattern may contain simple shell-style wildcards a la
fnmatch
However, unlike fnmatch, filenames starting with a
dot are special cases that are not matched by '*' and '?'
patterns.

If recursive is true, the pattern '**' will match any files and
zero or more directories and subdirectories.

==============================
glob.magic_check
Compiled regular expression object.

==============================
glob.magic_check_bytes
Compiled regular expression object.

==============================
glob.os
OS routines for NT or Posix depending on what system we're on.

This exports:
  - all functions from posix or nt, e.g
unlink, stat, etc.
  - os.path is either posixpath or ntpath
  - os.name is either 'posix' or 'nt'
  - os.curdir is a string representing the current directory (always '.')
  - os.pardir is a string representing the parent directory (always '..')
  - os.sep is the (or a most common) pathname separator ('/' or '\\')
  - os.extsep is the extension separator (always '.')
  - os.altsep is the alternate pathname separator (None or '/')
  - os.pathsep is the component separator used in $PATH etc
  - os.linesep is the line separator in text files ('\r' or '\n' or '\r\n')
  - os.defpath is the default search path for executables
  - os.devnull is the file path of the null device ('/dev/null', etc.)

Programs that import and use 'os' stand a better chance of being
portable between different platforms
 Of course, they must then
only use functions that are defined by all platforms (e.g., unlink
and opendir), and leave all pathname manipulation to os.path
(e.g., split and join).

==============================
glob.re
Support for regular expressions (RE).

This module provides regular expression matching operations similar to
those found in Perl
 It supports both 8-bit and Unicode strings; both
the pattern and the strings being processed can contain null bytes and
characters outside the US ASCII range.

Regular expressions can contain both special and ordinary characters.
Most ordinary characters, like "A", "a", or "0", are the simplest
regular expressions; they simply match themselves
 You can
concatenate ordinary characters, so last matches the string 'last'.

The special characters are:
    "."      Matches any character except a newline.
    "^"      Matches the start of the string.
    "$"      Matches the end of the string or just before the newline at
             the end of the string.
    "*"      Matches 0 or more (greedy) repetitions of the preceding RE.
             Greedy means that it will match as many repetitions as possible.
    "+"      Matches 1 or more (greedy) repetitions of the preceding RE.
    "?"      Matches 0 or 1 (greedy) of the preceding RE.
    *?,+?,?? Non-greedy versions of the previous three special characters.
    {m,n}    Matches from m to n repetitions of the preceding RE.
    {m,n}?   Non-greedy version of the above.
    "\\"     Either escapes special characters or signals a special sequence.
    []       Indicates a set of characters.
             A "^" as the first character indicates a complementing set.
    "|"      A|B, creates an RE that will match either A or B.
    (...)    Matches the RE inside the parentheses.
             The contents can be retrieved or matched later in the string.
    (?aiLmsux) The letters set the corresponding flags defined below.
    (?:...)  Non-grouping version of regular parentheses.
    (?P<name>...) The substring matched by the group is accessible by name.
    (?P=name)     Matches the text matched earlier by the group named name.
    (?#...)  A comment; ignored.
    (?=...)  Matches if ..
matches next, but doesn't consume the string.
    (?!...)  Matches if ..
doesn't match next.
    (?<=...) Matches if preceded by ..
(must be fixed length).
    (?<!...) Matches if not preceded by ..
(must be fixed length).
    (?(id/name)yes|no) Matches yes pattern if the group with id/name matched,
                       the (optional) no pattern otherwise.

The special sequences consist of "\\" and a character from the list
below
 If the ordinary character is not on the list, then the
resulting RE will match the second character.
    \number  Matches the contents of the group of the same number.
    \A       Matches only at the start of the string.
    \Z       Matches only at the end of the string.
    \b       Matches the empty string, but only at the start or end of a word.
    \B       Matches the empty string, but not at the start or end of a word.
    \d       Matches any decimal digit; equivalent to the set [0-9] in
             bytes patterns or string patterns with the ASCII flag.
             In string patterns without the ASCII flag, it will match the whole
             range of Unicode digits.
    \D       Matches any non-digit character; equivalent to [^\d].
    \s       Matches any whitespace character; equivalent to [ \t\n\r\f\v] in
             bytes patterns or string patterns with the ASCII flag.
             In string patterns without the ASCII flag, it will match the whole
             range of Unicode whitespace characters.
    \S       Matches any non-whitespace character; equivalent to [^\s].
    \w       Matches any alphanumeric character; equivalent to [a-zA-Z0-9_]
             in bytes patterns or string patterns with the ASCII flag.
             In string patterns without the ASCII flag, it will match the
             range of Unicode alphanumeric characters (letters plus digits
             plus underscore).
             With LOCALE, it will match the set [0-9_] plus characters defined
             as letters for the current locale.
    \W       Matches the complement of \w.
    \\       Matches a literal backslash.

This module exports the following functions:
    match     Match a regular expression pattern to the beginning of a string.
    fullmatch Match a regular expression pattern to all of a string.
    search    Search a string for the presence of a pattern.
    sub       Substitute occurrences of a pattern found in a string.
    subn      Same as sub, but also return the number of substitutions made.
    split     Split a string by the occurrences of a pattern.
    findall   Find all occurrences of a pattern in a string.
    finditer  Return an iterator yielding a Match object for each match.
    compile   Compile a pattern into a Pattern object.
    purge     Clear the regular expression cache.
    escape    Backslash all non-alphanumerics in a string.

Each function other than purge and escape can take an optional 'flags' argument
consisting of one or more of the following module constants, joined by "|".
A, L, and U are mutually exclusive.
    A  ASCII       For string patterns, make \w, \W, \b, \B, \d, \D
                   match the corresponding ASCII character categories
                   (rather than the whole Unicode categories, which is the
                   default).
                   For bytes patterns, this flag is the only available
                   behaviour and needn't be specified.
    I  IGNORECASE  Perform case-insensitive matching.
    L  LOCALE      Make \w, \W, \b, \B, dependent on the current locale.
    M  MULTILINE   "^" matches the beginning of lines (after a newline)
                   as well as the string.
                   "$" matches the end of lines (before a newline) as well
                   as the end of the string.
    S  DOTALL      "." matches any character at all, including the newline.
    X  VERBOSE     Ignore whitespace and comments for nicer looking RE's.
    U  UNICODE     For compatibility only
Ignored for string patterns (it
                   is the default), and forbidden for bytes patterns.

This module also defines an exception 'error'.

==============================
glob.sys
This module provides access to some objects used or maintained by the
interpreter and to functions that interact strongly with the interpreter.

Dynamic objects:

argv -- command line arguments; argv[0] is the script pathname if known
path -- module search path; path[0] is the script directory, else ''
modules -- dictionary of loaded modules

displayhook -- called to show results in an interactive session
excepthook -- called to handle any uncaught exception other than SystemExit
  To customize printing in an interactive session or to install a custom
  top-level exception handler, assign other functions to replace these.

stdin -- standard input file object; used by input()
stdout -- standard output file object; used by print()
stderr -- standard error object; used for error messages
  By assigning other file objects (or objects that behave like files)
  to these, it is possible to redirect all of the interpreter's I/O.

last_type -- type of last uncaught exception
last_value -- value of last uncaught exception
last_traceback -- traceback of last uncaught exception
  These three are only available in an interactive session after a
  traceback has been printed.

Static objects:

builtin_module_names -- tuple of module names built into this interpreter
copyright -- copyright notice pertaining to this interpreter
exec_prefix -- prefix used to find the machine-specific Python library
executable -- absolute path of the executable binary of the Python interpreter
float_info -- a named tuple with information about the float implementation.
float_repr_style -- string indicating the style of repr() output for floats
hash_info -- a named tuple with information about the hash algorithm.
hexversion -- version information encoded as a single integer
implementation -- Python implementation information.
int_info -- a named tuple with information about the int implementation.
maxsize -- the largest supported length of containers.
maxunicode -- the value of the largest Unicode code point
platform -- platform identifier
prefix -- prefix used to find the Python library
thread_info -- a named tuple with information about the thread implementation.
version -- the version of this interpreter as a string
version_info -- version information as a named tuple
__stdin__ -- the original stdin; don't touch!
__stdout__ -- the original stdout; don't touch!
__stderr__ -- the original stderr; don't touch!
__displayhook__ -- the original displayhook; don't touch!
__excepthook__ -- the original excepthook; don't touch!

Functions:

displayhook() -- print an object to the screen, and save it in builtins._
excepthook() -- print an exception and its traceback to sys.stderr
exc_info() -- return thread-safe information about the current exception
exit() -- exit the interpreter by raising SystemExit
getdlopenflags() -- returns flags to be used for dlopen() calls
getprofile() -- get the global profiling function
getrefcount() -- return the reference count for an object (plus one :-)
getrecursionlimit() -- return the max recursion depth for the interpreter
getsizeof() -- return the size of an object in bytes
gettrace() -- get the global debug tracing function
setcheckinterval() -- control how often the interpreter checks for events
setdlopenflags() -- set the flags to be used for dlopen() calls
setprofile() -- set the global profiling function
setrecursionlimit() -- set the max recursion depth for the interpreter
settrace() -- set the global debug tracing function
