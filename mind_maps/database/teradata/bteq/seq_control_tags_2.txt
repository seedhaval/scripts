    BTEQ sequence control tags
        IF
            Used to conditionally execute portions of the input script
            The IF clause can contain one or more conditions to enable testing multiple status values
            These individual checks can be ANDed or ORed together, as well as be negated via NOT operations
            When the collective test result is found to be TRUE, the THEN clause action gets taken
        LABEL
            Identifies the point at which BTEQ resumes processing, as specified in a previous GOTO command
        MAXERROR
            This control enables users to specify a maximum error severity level beyond which BTEQ terminates job processing
        OS
            Submits an operating system command to a workstation-attached system
        REPEAT
            This control enables users to specify the maximum number of times the next SQL request is to be submitted
        REPEATSTOP
            This control enables users to specify whether a REPEAT operation should terminate if an error occurs for a request that indicates the request cannot be re-tried
