    BTEQ SQL control tags
        AUTOKEYRETRIEVE
            This control enables users to specify whether the database returns values of any fields associated with Identity Data in response to subsequent SQL Insert operations
        COMPILE
            Defines (creates or replaces) an SQL stored procedure in the database using an SPL input file
        DECIMALDIGITS
            This control enables users to specify what precision the database should use for decimal values associated with subsequently issued SQL requests for non-Field Mode responses
            It overrides the precision specified by a CLI System Parameter Block (SPB) for max_decimal_ returned entry
        ENCRYPTION
            This control enables users to specify full-stream encryption of requests and responses is to be used at the request-level
            The initial value for the setting is based on the value of CLI's clispb dat file data_encryption entry
        INDICATORMODE
            This control enables users to specify Indicator Mode is to be used to return data rows from the Teradata Database in response to SQL data- returning requests
            The data format includes bytes for the indicator bits which identify null values
        LARGEDATAMODE
            This control enables users to specify whether Multipart Indicator response mode for Large Data Object (LDO) retrieval is to be used
        PACK
            This control enables users to specify the maximum number of import data file records that can be sent within an SQL request's USING data buffer
        RECORDLENGTH
            This control enables users to specify the maximum record (row) length that can be processed within the current session for imports, exports and stdout hex-dump output
        RECORDMODE
            This control enables users to specify whether Record mode is used to return data rows from the database in response to data-returning SQL requests
            Each returned row contains raw data without metadata, which is then presented in the same representation as it was returned in by the database, with byte ordering appropriate for the client system
