    cluster
        group events together based on similarity
        anomalous events are not grouped into big clusters
        field=
            default _raw
            cluster based on given field
        adds 2 fields to each event
            cluster_count
                change name with countfield=
            cluster_label
                change name with labelfield=
        t=
            threshold. between 0.0 and 1.0
            default 0.8
            more near to 1 means stricter grouping
        delims=
            delimiters used to tokenize string
            default - everything EXCEPT 0-9, a-z, A-Z, _
        shwocount=
            default is false
            if false, clustering is done on indexers before sending to search head
            if false, count field is not added to events
        cluster showcount=t
        cluster t=0.9 showcount=t
        labelonly
            if true, add labels to events
            if false, output is list of new events with description and count of events
