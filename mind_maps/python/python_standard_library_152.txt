            >>> c.most_common(3)                # three most common elements
        collections.Counter.clear
            D.clear() -> None
            Remove all items from D.
        collections.Counter.copy
            (self)
            Return a shallow copy.
        collections.Counter.elements
            (self)
            Iterator over elements repeating each as many times as its count.
        collections.Counter.fromkeys
            (iterable, v=None)
