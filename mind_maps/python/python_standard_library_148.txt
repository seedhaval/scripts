    base64
        base64.encodebytes
            (s)
            Encode a bytestring into a bytes object containing multiple lines of base-64 data.
        base64.encodestring
            (s)
            Legacy alias of encodebytes().
        base64.main
            ()
            Small main program
        base64.standard_b64decode
            (s)
            Decode bytes encoded with the standard Base64 alphabet.
            Argument s is a bytes-like object or ASCII string to decode
            The result is returned as a bytes object
            Characters that are not in the standard alphabet are discarded prior to the padding check.
        base64.standard_b64encode
            (s)
            Encode bytes-like object s using the standard Base64 alphabet.
            The result is returned as a bytes object.
