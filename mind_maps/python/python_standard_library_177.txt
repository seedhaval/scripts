python standard library
    subprocess
        subprocess.check_call
            (*popenargs, **kwargs)
            Run command with arguments
            Wait for command to complete
            If the exit code was zero then return, otherwise raise CalledProcessError
            The CalledProcessError object will have the return code in the returncode attribute.
            The arguments are the same as for the call function
            check_call(["ls", "-l"])
        subprocess.check_output
            (*popenargs, timeout=None, **kwargs)
            Run command with arguments and return its output.
            If the exit code was non-zero it raises a CalledProcessError
            The CalledProcessError object will have the return code in the returncode attribute and output in the output attribute.
            The arguments are the same as for the Popen constructor
            Example:
            >>> check_output(["ls", "-l", "/dev/null"])
        subprocess.getoutput
            (cmd)
            Return output (stdout or stderr) of executing cmd in a shell.
            Like getstatusoutput(), except the exit status is ignored and the return
            value is a string containing the command's output Example:
