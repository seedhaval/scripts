    os
        os.walk
            dirpath, do os.path.join(dirpath, name).
            If optional arg 'topdown' is true or not specified, the triple for a
            directory is generated before the triples for any of its subdirectories
            (directories are generated top down)
            If topdown is false, the triple
            for a directory is generated after the triples for all of its
            subdirectories (directories are generated bottom up).
            When topdown is true, the caller can modify the dirnames list in-place (e.g., via del or slice assignment), and walk will only recurse into the subdirectories whose names remain in dirnames; this can be used to prune the search, or to impose a specific order of visiting
            Modifying dirnames when topdown is false has no effect on the behavior of os.walk(), since the
            directories in dirnames have already been generated by the time dirnames itself is generated
            No matter the value of topdown, the list of subdirectories is retrieved before the tuples for the directory and its subdirectories are generated.
            If optional arg 'onerror' is specified, it should be a function; it will be called with one argument, an OSError instance
            It can report the error to continue with the walk, or raise the exception to abort the walk
            Note that the filename is available as the
            filename attribute of the exception object.
            By default, os.walk does not follow symbolic links to subdirectories on systems that support them
            In order to get this functionality, set the optional argument 'followlinks' to true.
