    argparse
        argparse.Action
            (option_strings, dest, nargs=None, const=None, default=None, type=None, choices=None, required=False, help=None, metavar=None)
            - option_strings -- A list of command-line option strings which should be associated with this action.
            - dest -- The name of the attribute to hold the created object(s)
            - nargs -- The number of command-line arguments that should be consumed
            By default, one argument will be consumed and a single value will be produced
            - N (an integer) consumes N arguments (and produces a list)
            - '?' consumes zero or one arguments
            - '*' consumes zero or more arguments (and produces a list)
            - '+' consumes one or more arguments (and produces a list)
            Note that the difference between the default and nargs=1 is that with the default, a single value will be produced, while with nargs=1, a list containing a single value will be produced.
            - const -- The value to be produced if the option is specified and the option uses an action that takes no values.
            - default -- The value to be produced if the option is not specified.
            - type -- A callable that accepts a single string argument, and returns the converted value
            The standard Python types str, int, float, and complex are useful examples of such callables If None, str is used.
            - choices -- A container of values that should be allowed
            If not None, after a command-line argument has been converted to the appropriate type, an exception will be raised if it is not a member of this collection.
            - required -- True if the action must always be specified at the command line This is only meaningful for optional command-line arguments.
            - help -- The help string describing the argument.
            - metavar -- The name to be used for the option's argument with the help string If None, the 'dest' value will be used as the name.
