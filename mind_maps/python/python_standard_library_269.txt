        logging.FileHandler.emit
            (self, record)
            Emit a record.
            If the stream was not opened because 'delay' was specified in the constructor, open it before calling the superclass's emit.
        logging.FileHandler.filter
            (self, record)
            Determine if a record is loggable by consulting all the filters.
            The default is to allow the record to be logged; any filter can veto this and the record is then dropped
            Returns a zero value if a record is to be dropped, else non-zero.
        logging.FileHandler.flush
            (self)
            Flushes the stream.
        logging.FileHandler.format
            (self, record)
            Format the specified record.
            If a formatter is set, use it
            Otherwise, use the default formatter for the module.
