        tarfile.TarFile.xzopen
            (name, mode='r', fileobj=None, preset=None, **kwargs)
            Open lzma compressed tar archive name for reading or writing.
            Appending is not allowed.

            (name=None, mode='r', fileobj=None, bufsize=10240, **kwargs)

    pathlib
        pathlib.Path
            (*args, **kwargs)
            PurePath subclass that can make system calls.
            Path represents a filesystem path but unlike PurePath, also offers methods to do system calls on path objects
            Depending on your system, instantiating a Path will return either a PosixPath or a WindowsPath object
            You can also instantiate a PosixPath or WindowsPath directly, but cannot instantiate a WindowsPath on a POSIX system or vice versa.
