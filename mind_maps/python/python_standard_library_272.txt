        logging.Filter
            (name='')
            Filter instances are used to perform arbitrary filtering of LogRecords.
            Loggers and Handlers can optionally use Filter instances to filter records as desired
            The base filter class only allows events which are below a certain point in the logger hierarchy
            For example, a filter initialized with "A.B" will allow events logged by loggers "A.B", "A.B.C", "A.B.C.D", "A.B.D" etc but not "A.BB", "B.A.B" etc
            If initialized with the empty string, all events are passed.
        logging.Filter.filter
            (self, record)
            Determine if the specified record is to be logged.
            Returns True if the record should be logged, or False otherwise.
            If deemed appropriate, the record may be modified in-place.
        logging.Filterer
            ()
            A base class for loggers and handlers which allows them to share common code.
