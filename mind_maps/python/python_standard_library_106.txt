    glob
        glob.has_magic
            (s)
        glob.iglob
            (pathname, *, recursive=False)
            Return an iterator which yields the paths matching a pathname pattern.
            The pattern may contain simple shell-style wildcards a la fnmatch
            However, unlike fnmatch, filenames starting with a dot are special cases that are not matched by '*' and '?' patterns.
            If recursive is true, the pattern '**' will match any files and zero or more directories and subdirectories.
    functools
        functools.cached_property
            (func)
            None
        functools.cmp_to_key
            Convert a cmp= function into a key= function.
        functools.lru_cache
            (maxsize=128, typed=False)
            Least-recently-used cache decorator.
            If *maxsize* is set to None, the LRU features are disabled and the cache can grow without bound.
            If *typed* is True, arguments of different types will be cached separately.  For example, f(3.0) and f(3) will be treated as distinct calls with distinct results.
            Arguments to the cached function must be hashable.
            View the cache statistics named tuple (hits, misses, maxsize, currsize) with f.cache_info()
            Clear the cache and statistics with f.cache_clear().
            Access the underlying function with f.__wrapped__.
