    time
        time.thread_time_ns
            thread_time() -> int
            Thread time for profiling as nanoseconds:
            sum of the kernel and user-space CPU time.
        time.time
            time() -> floating point number
            Return the current time in seconds since the Epoch.
            Fractions of a second may be present if the system clock provides them.
        time.time_ns
            time_ns() -> int
            Return the current time in nanoseconds since the Epoch.
        time.timezone
            int([x]) -> integer
        time.tzname
            Built-in immutable sequence.
        time.tzset
            tzset()
            Initialize, or reinitialize, the local timezone to the value stored in os.environ['TZ']
            The TZ environment variable should be specified in standard Unix timezone format as documented in the tzset man page
            'US/Eastern', 'Europe/Amsterdam')
            Unknown timezones will silently fall back to UTC
            If the TZ environment variable is not set, the local timezone is set to the systems best guess of wallclock time.
