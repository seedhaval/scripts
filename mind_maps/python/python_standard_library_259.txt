    pathlib
        pathlib.Path.joinpath
            (self, *args)
            Combine this path with one or several arguments, and return a new path representing either a subpath (if all arguments are relative paths) or a totally different path (if one of the arguments is anchored).
        pathlib.Path.lchmod
            (self, mode)
            Like chmod(), except if the path points to a symlink, the symlink's permissions are changed, rather than its target's.
        pathlib.Path.link_to
            (self, target)
            Make the target path a hard link pointing to this path.
            Note this function does not make this path a hard link to *target*, despite the implication of the function and argument names
            The order of arguments (target, link) is the reverse of Path.symlink_to, but matches that of os.link.
        pathlib.Path.lstat
            (self)
            Like stat(), except if the path points to a symlink, the symlink's status information is returned, rather than its target's.
        pathlib.Path.match
            (self, path_pattern)
            Return True if this path matches the given pattern.
