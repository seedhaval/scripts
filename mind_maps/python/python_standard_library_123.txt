    time
        time.clock_gettime
            clock_gettime(clk_id) -> float
            Return the time of the specified clock clk_id.
        time.clock_gettime_ns
            clock_gettime_ns(clk_id) -> int
            Return the time of the specified clock clk_id as nanoseconds.
        time.clock_settime
            clock_settime(clk_id, time)
            Set the time of the specified clock clk_id.
        time.clock_settime_ns
            clock_settime_ns(clk_id, time)
            Set the time of the specified clock clk_id with nanoseconds.
        time.ctime
            ctime(seconds) -> string
            Convert a time in seconds since the Epoch to a string in local time.
            This is equivalent to asctime(localtime(seconds))
            When the time tuple is not present, current time as returned by localtime() is used.
