        configparser.ConfigParser.read_dict
            (self, dictionary, source='<dict>')
            Read configuration from a dictionary.
            Keys are section names, values are dictionaries with keys and values
            that should be present in the section
            If the used dictionary type preserves order, sections and their keys will be added in order.
            All types held in the dictionary are converted to strings during reading, including section names, option names and keys.
            Optional second argument is the `source' specifying the name of the dictionary being read.
        configparser.ConfigParser.read_file
            (self, f, source=None)
            Like read() but the argument must be a file-like object.
            The `f' argument must be iterable, returning one line at a time.
            Optional second argument is the `source' specifying the name of the file being read
            If not given, it is taken from f.name
            If `f' has no `name' attribute, `<???>' is used.
        configparser.ConfigParser.read_string
            (self, string, source='<string>')
            Read configuration from a given string.
