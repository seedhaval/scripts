    glob
        glob.fnmatch
            Filename matching with shell patterns.
            fnmatch(FILENAME, PATTERN) matches according to the local convention.
            fnmatchcase(FILENAME, PATTERN) always takes case in account.
            The functions operate by translating the pattern into a regular expression
            They cache the compiled regular expressions for speed.
            The function translate(PATTERN) returns a regular expression corresponding to PATTERN
            (It does not compile it.)
        glob.glob
            (pathname, *, recursive=False)
            Return a list of paths matching a pathname pattern.
            The pattern may contain simple shell-style wildcards a la fnmatch
            However, unlike fnmatch, filenames starting with a dot are special cases that are not matched by '*' and '?' patterns.
            If recursive is true, the pattern '**' will match any files and zero or more directories and subdirectories.
        glob.glob0
            (dirname, pattern)
        glob.glob1
            (dirname, pattern)
