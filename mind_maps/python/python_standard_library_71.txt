        requests.Response.iter_lines
            (self, chunk_size=512, decode_unicode=False, delimiter=None)
            Iterates over the response data, one line at a time
            When stream=True is set on the request, this avoids reading the content at once into memory for large responses.
        requests.Response.json
            (self, **kwargs)
            Returns the json-encoded content of a response, if any.
            :param \*\*kwargs: Optional arguments that ``json.loads`` takes.
            :raises ValueError: If the response body does not contain valid json.
        requests.Response.links
            Returns the parsed header links of the response, if any.
        requests.Response.next
            Returns a PreparedRequest for the next request in a redirect chain, if there is one.
        requests.Response.ok
            Returns True if :attr:`status_code` is less than 400, False if not.
            This attribute checks if the status code of the response is between 400 and 600 to see if there was a client error or a server error
            If the status code is between 200 and 400, this will return True
            This is **not** a check to see if the response code is ``200 OK``.
