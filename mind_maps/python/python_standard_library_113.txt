            (a, b, ignore=None, hide=None)
            A class that manages the comparison of 2 directories.
            dircmp(a, b, ignore=None, hide=None)
            A and B are directories.
            IGNORE is a list of names to ignore,
            defaults to DEFAULT_IGNORES.
            HIDE is a list of names to hide, defaults to [os.curdir, os.pardir].
            x.report() -> prints a report on the differences between dir1 and dir2
            x.report_partial_closure() -> prints report on differences between dir1 and dir2, and reports on common immediate subdirectories.
            x.report_full_closure() -> like report_partial_closure, but fully recursive.
            left_list, right_list: The files in dir1 and dir2, filtered by hide and ignore.
            common: a list of names in both dir1 and dir2.
            left_only, right_only: names only in dir1, dir2.
            common_dirs: subdirectories in both dir1 and dir2.
            common_files: files in both dir1 and dir2.
            common_funny: names in both dir1 and dir2 where the type differs between dir1 and dir2, or the name is not stat-able.
            same_files: list of identical files.
            diff_files: list of filenames which differ.
            funny_files: list of files which could not be compared.
            subdirs: a dictionary of dircmp objects, keyed by names in common_dirs.
