    tarfile
        tarfile.TarFile.makefile
            (self, tarinfo, targetpath)
            Make a file called targetpath.
        tarfile.TarFile.makelink
            (self, tarinfo, targetpath)
            Make a (symbolic) link called targetpath
            If it cannot be created (platform limitation), we try to make a copy of the referenced file instead of a link.
        tarfile.TarFile.makeunknown
            (self, tarinfo, targetpath)
            Make a file from a TarInfo object with an unknown type at targetpath.
        tarfile.TarFile.next
            (self)
            Return the next member of the archive as a TarInfo object, when
            TarFile is opened for reading
            Return None if there is no more available.
        tarfile.TarFile.open
            (name=None, mode='r', fileobj=None, bufsize=10240, **kwargs)
            Open a tar archive for reading, writing or appending
            Return
            an appropriate TarFile class.
