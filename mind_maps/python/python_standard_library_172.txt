    sys
        sys.exit
            (status=None, /)
            Exit the interpreter by raising SystemExit(status).
            If the status is omitted or None, it defaults to zero (i.e., success).
            If the status is an integer, it will be used as the system exit status.
            If it is another kind of object, it will be printed and the system exit status will be one (i.e., failure).
        sys.getrefcount
            (object, /)
            Return the reference count of object.
            The count returned is generally one higher than you might expect,
            because it includes the (temporary) reference as an argument to
            getrefcount().
        sys.getsizeof
            getsizeof(object [, default]) -> int
            Return the size of object in bytes.
