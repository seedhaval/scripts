        pathlib.Path.absolute
            (self)
            Return an absolute version of this path
            This function works even if the path doesn't point to anything.
            No normalization is done, i.e all '.' and '..' will be kept along.
            Use resolve() to get the canonical path to a file.
        pathlib.Path.anchor
            The concatenation of the drive and root, or ''.
        pathlib.Path.as_posix
            (self)
            Return the string representation of the path with forward (/) slashes.
        pathlib.Path.as_uri
            (self)
            Return the path as a 'file' URI.
        pathlib.Path.chmod
            (self, mode)
            Change the permissions of the path, like os.chmod().
