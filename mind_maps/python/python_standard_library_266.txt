    pathlib
        pathlib.S_ISLNK
            S_ISLNK(mode) -> bool
            Return True if mode is from a symbolic link.
        pathlib.S_ISREG
            S_ISREG(mode) -> bool
            Return True if mode is from a regular file.
        pathlib.S_ISSOCK
            S_ISSOCK(mode) -> bool
            Return True if mode is from a socket.
        pathlib.fnmatch
            Filename matching with shell patterns.
            fnmatch(FILENAME, PATTERN) matches according to the local convention.
            fnmatchcase(FILENAME, PATTERN) always takes case in account.
            The functions operate by translating the pattern into a regular expression
            They cache the compiled regular expressions for speed.
            The function translate(PATTERN) returns a regular expression corresponding to PATTERN (It does not compile it.)
