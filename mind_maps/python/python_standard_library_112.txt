    filecmp
        filecmp.clear_cache
            ()
            Clear the filecmp cache.
        filecmp.cmp
            (f1, f2, shallow=True)
            Compare two files.
            f1 -- First file name
            f2 -- Second file name
            shallow -- Just check stat signature (do not read the files).  defaults to True.
            True if the files are the same, False otherwise.
            This function uses a cache for past comparisons and the results,
            with cache entries invalidated if their stat information changes
            The cache may be cleared by calling clear_cache().
        filecmp.cmpfiles
            (a, b, common, shallow=True)
            Compare common files in two directories.
            a, b -- directory names
            common -- list of file names found in both directories
            shallow -- if true, do comparison based solely on stat() information
            Returns a tuple of three lists: files that compare equal files that are different filenames that aren't regular files.
