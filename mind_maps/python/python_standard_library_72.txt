    requests
        requests.Response.raise_for_status
            (self)
            Raises stored :class:`HTTPError`, if one occurred.
        requests.Response.text
            Content of the response, in unicode.
            If Response.encoding is None, encoding will be guessed using ``chardet``.
            The encoding of the response content is determined based solely on HTTP headers, following RFC 2616 to the letter
            If you can take advantage of non-HTTP knowledge to make a better guess at the encoding, you should set ``r.encoding`` appropriately before accessing this property.
        requests.Session
            ()
            A Requests session.
            Provides cookie persistence, connection-pooling, and configuration.
        requests.Session.close
            (self)
            Closes all adapters and as such the session
        requests.Session.delete
            (self, url, **kwargs)
            Sends a DELETE request
            Returns :class:`Response` object.
            :param url: URL for the new :class:`Request` object.
            :param \*\*kwargs: Optional arguments that ``request`` takes.
            :rtype: requests.Response
