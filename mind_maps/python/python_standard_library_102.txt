    itertools
        itertools.takewhile
            (predicate, iterable, /)
            Return successive entries from an iterable as long as the predicate evaluates to true for each entry.
        itertools.tee
            (iterable, n=2, /)
            Returns a tuple of n independent iterators.
        itertools.zip_longest
            zip_longest(iter1 [,iter2 [...]], [fillvalue=None]) --> zip_longest object
            Return a zip_longest object whose .__next__() method returns a tuple where the i-th element comes from the i-th iterable argument
            The .__next__() method continues until the longest iterable in the argument sequence is exhausted and then it raises StopIteration
            When the shorter iterables are exhausted, the fillvalue is substituted in their place
            The fillvalue defaults to None or can be specified by a keyword argument.
    html
        html.entities
            HTML character entity references.
        html.escape
            (s, quote=True)
            Replace special characters "&", "<" and ">" to HTML-safe sequences.
            If the optional flag quote is true (the default), the quotation mark characters, both double quote (") and single quote (') characters are also translated.
