        csv.StringIO.readline
            (self, size=-1, /)
            Read until newline or EOF.
            Returns an empty string if EOF is hit immediately.
        csv.StringIO.readlines
            (self, hint=-1, /)
            Return a list of lines from the stream.
            hint can be specified to control the number of lines read: no more lines will be read if the total size (in bytes/characters) of all lines so far exceeds hint.
        csv.StringIO.seek
            (self, pos, whence=0, /)
            Change stream position.
            Seek to character offset pos relative to position indicated by whence:
            0  Start of stream (the default)
            pos should be >= 0;
            1  Current position - pos must be 0;
            2  End of stream - pos must be 0.
            Returns the new absolute position.
