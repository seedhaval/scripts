        collections.ChainMap
            (*maps)
            A ChainMap groups multiple dicts (or other mappings) together to create a single, updateable view.
            The underlying mappings are stored in a list
            That list is public and can be accessed or updated using the *maps* attribute
            There is no other state.
            Lookups search the underlying mappings successively until a key is found.
            In contrast, writes, updates, and deletions only operate on the first mapping.
        collections.ChainMap.clear
            (self)
            Clear maps[0], leaving maps[1:] intact.
        collections.ChainMap.copy
            (self)
            New ChainMap or subclass with a new copy of maps[0] and refs to maps[1:]
        collections.ChainMap.fromkeys
            (iterable, *args)
            Create a ChainMap with a single dict created from the iterable.
