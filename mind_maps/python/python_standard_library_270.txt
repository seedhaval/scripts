            (self)
        logging.FileHandler.handle
            (self, record)
            Conditionally emit the specified logging record.
            Emission depends on filters which may have been added to the handler.
            Wrap the actual emission of the record with acquisition/release of the I/O thread lock
            Returns whether the filter passed the record for emission.
        logging.FileHandler.handleError
            (self, record)
            Handle errors which occur during an emit() call.
            This method should be called from handlers when an exception is encountered during an emit() call
            If raiseExceptions is false, exceptions get silently ignored
            This is what is mostly wanted for a logging system - most users will not care about errors in the logging system, they are more interested in application errors.
            You could, however, replace this with a custom handler if you wish.
            The record which was being processed is passed in to this method.
