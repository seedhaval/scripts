        logging.Logger.filter
            (self, record)
            Determine if a record is loggable by consulting all the filters.
            The default is to allow the record to be logged; any filter can veto this and the record is then dropped
            Returns a zero value if a record is to be dropped, else non-zero.
        logging.Logger.findCaller
            (self, stack_info=False, stacklevel=1)
            Find the stack frame of the caller so that we can note the source file name, line number and function name.
        logging.Logger.getChild
            (self, suffix)
            Get a logger which is a descendant to this one.
            This is a convenience method, such that logging.getLogger('abc').getChild('def.ghi') is the same as logging.getLogger('abc.def.ghi')
            It's useful, for example, when the parent logger is named using __name__ rather than a literal string.
        logging.Logger.getEffectiveLevel
            (self)
            Get the effective level for this logger.
            Loop through this logger and its parents in the logger hierarchy, looking for a non-zero logging level
            Return the first one found.
