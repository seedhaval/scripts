    shutil
        shutil.move
            (src, dst, copy_function=<function copy2 at 0x7f764669b280>)
            Recursively move a file or directory to another location
            This is similar to the Unix "mv" command
            Return the file or directory's destination.
            The destination path must not already exist.
            The optional `copy_function` argument is a callable that will be used to copy the source or it will be delegated to `copytree`.
            By default, copy2() is used, but any function that supports the same signature (like copy()) can be used.
        shutil.rmtree
            (path, ignore_errors=False, onerror=None)
            Recursively delete a directory tree.
            If ignore_errors is set, errors are ignored; otherwise, if onerror is set, it is called to handle the error with arguments (func, path, exc_info) where func is platform and implementation dependent; path is the argument to that function that caused it to fail; and exc_info is a tuple returned by sys.exc_info()
        shutil.unpack_archive
            (filename, extract_dir=None, format=None)
            Unpack an archive.
            `filename` is the name of the archive.
            `extract_dir` is the name of the target directory, where the archive is unpacked
            If not provided, the current working directory is used.
            `format` is the archive format: one of "zip", "tar", "gztar", "bztar", or "xztar"
