        pathlib.Path.read_bytes
            (self)
            Open the file in bytes mode, read it, and close the file.
        pathlib.Path.read_text
            (self, encoding=None, errors=None)
            Open the file in text mode, read it, and close the file.
        pathlib.Path.relative_to
            (self, *other)
            Return the relative path to another path identified by the passed arguments
            If the operation is not possible (because this is not a subpath of the other path), raise ValueError.
        pathlib.Path.rename
            (self, target)
            Rename this path to the target path.
            The target path may be absolute or relative
            Relative paths are interpreted relative to the current working directory, *not* the directory of the Path object.
            Returns the new Path instance pointing to the target path.
        pathlib.Path.replace
            (self, target)
            Rename this path to the target path, overwriting if that path exists.
            The target path may be absolute or relative
            Relative paths are interpreted relative to the current working directory, *not* the directory of the Path object.
            Returns the new Path instance pointing to the target path.
