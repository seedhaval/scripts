    tarfile
        tarfile.TarFile.fileobject.writable
            (self, /)
            Return whether object was opened for writing.
            If False, write() will raise OSError.
        tarfile.TarFile.fileobject.write
            Write the given buffer to the IO stream.
            Returns the number of bytes written, which is always the length of b in bytes.
            Raises BlockingIOError if the buffer is full and the underlying raw stream cannot accept more data at the moment.
        tarfile.TarFile.fileobject.writelines
            (self, lines, /)
            Write a list of lines to stream.
            Line separators are not added, so it is usual for each of the lines provided to have a line separator at the end.
        tarfile.TarFile.format
            int([x]) -> integer
        tarfile.TarFile.getmember
            (self, name)
            Return a TarInfo object for member `name' If `name' can not be found in the archive, KeyError is raised
            If a member occurs more than once in the archive, its last occurrence is assumed to be the most up-to-date version.
