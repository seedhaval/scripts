        pathlib.Path.resolve
            (self, strict=False)
            Make the path absolute, resolving all symlinks on the way and also normalizing it (for example turning slashes into backslashes under Windows).
        pathlib.Path.rglob
            (self, pattern)
            Recursively yield all existing files (of any kind, including directories) matching the given relative pattern, anywhere in this subtree.
        pathlib.Path.rmdir
            (self)
            Remove this directory
            The directory must be empty.
        pathlib.Path.root
            The root of the path, if any.
        pathlib.Path.samefile
            (self, other_path)
            Return whether other_path is the same or not as this file
            (as returned by os.path.samefile()).
        pathlib.Path.stat
            (self)
            Return the result of the stat() system call on this path, like os.stat() does.
