    cmd
        cmd.Cmd.cmdloop
            (self, intro=None)
            Repeatedly issue a prompt, accept input, parse an initial prefix off the received input, and dispatch to action methods, passing them the remainder of the line as argument.
        cmd.Cmd.columnize
            (self, list, displaywidth=80)
            Display a list of strings as a compact set of columns.
            Each column is only as wide as necessary.
            Columns are separated by two spaces (one was not legible enough).
        cmd.Cmd.complete
            (self, text, state)
            Return the next possible completion for 'text'.
            If a command has not been entered, then complete against command list.
            Otherwise try to call complete_<command> to get list of completions.
        cmd.Cmd.complete_help
            (self, *args)
        cmd.Cmd.completedefault
            (self, *ignored)
            Method called to complete an input line when no command-specific complete_*() method is available.
            By default, it returns an empty list.
