        logging.error
            (msg, *args, **kwargs)
            Log a message with severity 'ERROR' on the root logger
            If the logger has no handlers, call basicConfig() to add a console handler with a pre-defined format.
        logging.exception
            (msg, *args, exc_info=True, **kwargs)
            Log a message with severity 'ERROR' on the root logger, with exception information
            If the logger has no handlers, basicConfig() is called to add a console handler with a pre-defined format.
        logging.fatal
            (msg, *args, **kwargs)
            Log a message with severity 'CRITICAL' on the root logger
            If the logger has no handlers, call basicConfig() to add a console handler with a pre-defined format.
        logging.getLevelName
            (level)
            Return the textual or numeric representation of logging level 'level'.
            If the level is one of the predefined levels (CRITICAL, ERROR, WARNING, INFO, DEBUG) then you get the corresponding string
            If you have associated levels with names using addLevelName then the name you have associated with 'level' is returned.
            If a numeric value corresponding to one of the defined levels is passed in, the corresponding string representation is returned.
            If a string representation of the level is passed in, the corresponding numeric value is returned.
            If no matching numeric or string value is passed in, the string 'Level %s' % level is returned.
