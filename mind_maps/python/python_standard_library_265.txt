        pathlib.PurePath
            (*args)
            Base class for manipulating paths without I/O.
            PurePath represents a filesystem path and offers operations which don't imply any actual filesystem I/O
            Depending on your system, instantiating a PurePath will return either a PurePosixPath or a PureWindowsPath object
            You can also instantiate either of these classes directly, regardless of your system.
        pathlib.S_ISBLK
            S_ISBLK(mode) -> bool
            Return True if mode is from a block special device file.
        pathlib.S_ISCHR
            S_ISCHR(mode) -> bool
            Return True if mode is from a character special device file.
        pathlib.S_ISDIR
            S_ISDIR(mode) -> bool
            Return True if mode is from a directory.
        pathlib.S_ISFIFO
            S_ISFIFO(mode) -> bool
            Return True if mode is from a FIFO (named pipe).
