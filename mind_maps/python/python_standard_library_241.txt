        tarfile.TarFile.fileobject.read
            (self, size=-1, /)
            Read and return up to n bytes.
            If the argument is omitted, None, or negative, reads and returns all data until EOF.
            If the argument is positive, and the underlying raw stream is not 'interactive', multiple raw reads may be issued to satisfy the byte count (unless EOF is reached first)
            But for interactive raw streams (as well as sockets and pipes), at most one raw read will be issued, and a short result does not imply that EOF is imminent.
            Returns an empty bytes object on EOF.
            Returns None if the underlying raw stream was open in non-blocking mode and no data is available at the moment.
        tarfile.TarFile.fileobject.read1
            (self, size=-1, /)
            Read and return up to n bytes, with at most one read() call to the underlying raw stream
            A short result does not imply that EOF is imminent.
            Returns an empty bytes object on EOF.
