        configparser.SafeConfigParser.read
            (self, filenames, encoding=None)
            Read and parse a filename or an iterable of filenames.
            Files that cannot be opened are silently ignored; this is designed so that you can specify an iterable of potential configuration file locations (e.g current directory, user's home directory, systemwide directory), and all existing configuration files in the iterable will be read
            A single filename may also be given.
            Return list of successfully read files.
        configparser.SafeConfigParser.read_dict
            (self, dictionary, source='<dict>')
            Read configuration from a dictionary.
            Keys are section names, values are dictionaries with keys and values that should be present in the section
            If the used dictionary type preserves order, sections and their keys will be added in order.
            All types held in the dictionary are converted to strings during
            reading, including section names, option names and keys.
            Optional second argument is the `source' specifying the name of the dictionary being read.
        configparser.SafeConfigParser.read_file
            (self, f, source=None)
            Like read() but the argument must be a file-like object.
            The `f' argument must be iterable, returning one line at a time.
            Optional second argument is the `source' specifying the name of the file being read
            If not given, it is taken from f.name If `f' has no `name' attribute, `<???>' is used.
