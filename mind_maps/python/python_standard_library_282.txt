    logging
        logging.Logger.root
            A root logger is not that different to any other logger, except that it must have a logging level and there is only one instance of it in the hierarchy.
        logging.Logger.setLevel
            (self, level)
            Set the logging level of this logger level must be an int or a str.
        logging.Logger.warn
            (self, msg, *args, **kwargs)
        logging.Logger.warning
            (self, msg, *args, **kwargs)
            Log 'msg % args' with severity 'WARNING'.
            To pass exception information, use the keyword argument exc_info with a true value, e.g.
            logger.warning("Houston, we have a %s", "bit of a problem", exc_info=1)
        logging.LoggerAdapter
            (logger, extra)
            An adapter for loggers which makes it easier to specify contextual information in logging output.
        logging.Manager
            (rootnode)
            There is [under normal circumstances] just one Manager instance, which holds the hierarchy of loggers.
