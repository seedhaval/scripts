    time
        time.daylight
            int([x]) -> integer
        time.get_clock_info
            get_clock_info(name: str) -> dict
            Get information of the specified clock.
        time.gmtime
            gmtime([seconds]) -> (tm_year, tm_mon, tm_mday, tm_hour, tm_min, tm_sec, tm_wday, tm_yday, tm_isdst)
            Convert seconds since the Epoch to a time tuple expressing UTC (a.k.a.  GMT)
            When 'seconds' is not passed in, convert the current time instead.
            If the platform supports the tm_gmtoff and tm_zone, they are available as attributes only.
        time.localtime
            localtime([seconds]) -> (tm_year,tm_mon,tm_mday,tm_hour,tm_min, tm_sec,tm_wday,tm_yday,tm_isdst)
            Convert seconds since the Epoch to a time tuple expressing local time.
            When 'seconds' is not passed in, convert the current time instead.
        time.mktime
            mktime(tuple) -> floating point number
            Convert a time tuple in local time to seconds since the Epoch.
            Note that mktime(gmtime(0)) will not generally return zero for most time zones; instead the returned value will either be equal to that of the timezone or altzone attributes on the time module.
