        shutil.make_archive
            (base_name, format, root_dir=None, base_dir=None, verbose=0, dry_run=0, owner=None, group=None, logger=None)
            Create an archive file (eg zip or tar).
            'base_name' is the name of the file to create, minus any format-specific extension;
            'format' is the archive format: one of "zip", "tar", "gztar", "bztar", or "xztar" Or any other registered format.
            'root_dir' is a directory that will be the root directory of the archive; ie we typically chdir into 'root_dir' before creating the archive
            'base_dir' is the directory where we start archiving from; ie 'base_dir' will be the common prefix of all files and directories in the archive
            'root_dir' and 'base_dir' both default to the current directory
            Returns the name of the archive file.
            'owner' and 'group' are used when creating a tar archive
            By default, uses the current owner and group.
