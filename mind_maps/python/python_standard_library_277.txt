        logging.Logger.addFilter
            (self, filter)
            Add the specified filter to this handler.
        logging.Logger.addHandler
            (self, hdlr)
            Add the specified handler to this logger.
        logging.Logger.callHandlers
            (self, record)
            Pass a record to all relevant handlers.
            Loop through all handlers for this logger and its parents in the logger hierarchy
            If no handler was found, output a one-off error message to sys.stderr
            Stop searching up the hierarchy whenever a logger with the "propagate" attribute set to zero is found - that will be the last logger whose handlers are called.
        logging.Logger.critical
            (self, msg, *args, **kwargs)
            Log 'msg % args' with severity 'CRITICAL'.
            To pass exception information, use the keyword argument exc_info with a true value, e.g.
            logger.critical("Houston, we have a %s", "major disaster", exc_info=1)
