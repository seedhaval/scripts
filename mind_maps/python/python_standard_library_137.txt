    cmd
        cmd.Cmd
            (completekey='tab', stdin=None, stdout=None)
            A simple framework for writing line-oriented command interpreters.
            A Cmd instance or subclass instance is a line-oriented interpreter framework
            There is no good reason to instantiate Cmd itself; rather, it's useful as a superclass of an interpreter class you define yourself in order to inherit Cmd's methods and encapsulate action methods.
