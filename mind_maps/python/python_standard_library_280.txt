        logging.Logger.handle
            (self, record)
            Call the handlers for the specified record.
            This method is used for unpickled records received from a socket, as well as those created locally
            Logger-level filtering is applied.
        logging.Logger.hasHandlers
            (self)
            See if this logger has any handlers configured.
            Loop through all handlers for this logger and its parents in the logger hierarchy
            Return True if a handler was found, else False.
            Stop searching up the hierarchy whenever a logger with the "propagate" attribute set to zero is found - that will be the last logger which is checked for the existence of handlers.
        logging.Logger.info
            (self, msg, *args, **kwargs)
            Log 'msg % args' with severity 'INFO'.
            To pass exception information, use the keyword argument exc_info with a true value, e.g.
            logger.info("Houston, we have a %s", "interesting problem", exc_info=1)
        logging.Logger.isEnabledFor
            (self, level)
            Is this logger enabled for level 'level'?
