        functools.recursive_repr
            (fillvalue='...')
            Decorator to make a repr function return fillvalue for a recursive call
        functools.reduce
            reduce(function, sequence[, initial]) -> value
            Apply a function of two arguments cumulatively to the items of a sequence, from left to right, so as to reduce the sequence to a single value.
            For example, reduce(lambda x, y: x+y, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) calculates
            If initial is present, it is placed before the items of the sequence in the calculation, and serves as a default when the sequence is empty.
        functools.singledispatch
            (func)
            Single-dispatch generic function decorator.
            Transforms a function into a generic function, which can have different behaviours depending upon the type of its first argument
            The decorated function acts as the default implementation, and additional implementations can be registered using the register() attribute of the generic function.
        functools.singledispatchmethod
            (func)
            Single-dispatch generic method descriptor.
            Supports wrapping existing descriptors and handles non-descriptor callables as instance methods.
