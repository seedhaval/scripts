        collections.Counter.setdefault
            (self, key, default=None, /)
            Insert key with a value of default if key is not in the dictionary.
            Return the value for key if key is in the dictionary, else default.
        collections.Counter.subtract
            (self, iterable=None, /, **kwds)
            Like dict.update() but subtracts counts instead of replacing them.
            Counts can be reduced below zero
            Both the inputs and outputs are
            allowed to contain zero and negative counts.
            Source can be an iterable, a dictionary, or another Counter instance.
        collections.Counter.update
            (self, iterable=None, /, **kwds)
            Like dict.update() but add counts instead of replacing them.
            Source can be an iterable, a dictionary, or another Counter instance.
        collections.Counter.values
            D.values() -> an object providing a view on D's values
