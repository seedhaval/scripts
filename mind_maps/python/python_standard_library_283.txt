        logging.Manager.getLogger
            (self, name)
            Get a logger with the specified name (channel name), creating it if it doesn't yet exist
            This name is a dot-separated hierarchical name, such as "a", "a.b", "a.b.c" or similar.
            If a PlaceHolder existed for the specified name [i.e the logger didn't exist but a child of it did], replace it with the created logger and fix up the parent/child references which pointed to the placeholder to now point to the logger.

        logging.Manager.setLoggerClass
            (self, klass)
