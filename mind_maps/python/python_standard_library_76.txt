        requests.Session.rebuild_auth
            (self, prepared_request, response)
            When being redirected we may want to strip authentication from the request to avoid leaking credentials
            This method intelligently removes and reapplies authentication where possible to avoid credential loss.
        requests.Session.rebuild_method
            (self, prepared_request, response)
            When being redirected we may want to change the method of the request based on certain specs or browser behavior.
        requests.Session.rebuild_proxies
            (self, prepared_request, proxies)
            This method re-evaluates the proxy configuration by considering the environment variables
            If we are redirected to a URL covered by NO_PROXY, we strip the proxy configuration Otherwise, we set missing proxy keys for this URL (in case they were stripped by a previous redirect).
            This method also replaces the Proxy-Authorization header where necessary.
