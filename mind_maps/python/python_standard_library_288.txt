        logging.WARN
            int([x]) -> integer
        logging.WARNING
            int([x]) -> integer
        logging.addLevelName
            (level, levelName)
            Associate 'levelName' with 'level'.
            This is used when converting levels to text during message formatting.
        logging.atexit
            allow programmer to define multiple exit functions to be executedupon normal program termination.
            Two public functions, register and unregister, are defined.
        logging.basicConfig
            (**kwargs)
            Do basic configuration for the logging system.
            This function does nothing if the root logger already has handlers configured, unless the keyword argument *force* is set to ``True``.
            It is a convenience method intended for use by simple scripts to do one-shot configuration of the logging package.
            The default behaviour is to create a StreamHandler which writes to sys.stderr, set a formatter using the BASIC_FORMAT format string, and add the handler to the root logger.
            the default behaviour.
            filename  Specifies that a FileHandler be created, using the specified filename, rather than a StreamHandler.
            filemode  Specifies the mode to open the file, if filename is specified (if filemode is unspecified, it defaults to 'a').
            format    Use the specified format string for the handler.
            datefmt   Use the specified date/time format.
            style     If a format string is specified, use this to specify the type of format string (possible values '%', '{', '$', for %-formatting, :meth:`str.format` and :class:`string.Template` - defaults to '%').
            level     Set the root logger level to the specified level.
            stream    Use the specified stream to initialize the StreamHandler
            handlers  If specified, this should be an iterable of already created handlers, which will be added to the root handler Any handler in the list which does not have a formatter assigned will be assigned the formatter created in this function.
            force     If this keyword  is specified as true, any existing handlers attached to the root logger are removed and closed, before carrying out the configuration as specified by the other arguments.
