        requests.Response
            ()
            The :class:`Response <Response>` object, which contains a
            server's response to an HTTP request.
        requests.Response.apparent_encoding
            The apparent encoding, provided by the chardet library.
        requests.Response.close
            (self)
        requests.Response.content
            Content of the response, in bytes.
        requests.Response.is_permanent_redirect
            True if this Response one of the permanent versions of redirect.
        requests.Response.is_redirect
            True if this Response is a well-formed HTTP redirect that could have
            been processed automatically (by :meth:`Session.resolve_redirects`).
        requests.Response.iter_content
            (self, chunk_size=1, decode_unicode=False)
            Iterates over the response data
            When stream=True is set on the request, this avoids reading the content at once into memory for large responses
            The chunk size is the number of bytes it should read into memory This is not necessarily the length of each item returned as decoding can take place.  chunk_size must be of type int or None
            A value of None will function differently depending on the value of `stream`.  stream=True will read data as it arrives in whatever size the chunks are received
            If stream=False, data is returned as a single chunk.
            If decode_unicode is True, content will be decoded using the best available encoding based on the response.
